Are you...

- _Trying to learn Redux in order to find a job?_
- _Having trouble showing potential employers what you're capable of?_
- _Need some accountability to stay motivated to finish projects?_

Sign up for the "Build an App with Redux" Club!

## What's this club thing?

egghead is putting together a group of developers to work on building and documenting the creation of a portfolio project that uses Redux.

Each week we will meet for one hour to discuss the work done, learning resources reviewed, and participate in activities related to our Redux projects.

As part of the project club, we will all be using a similar technology stack, but ultimately _what_ you build and _how_ you build it is up to you.

The most important thing is that you commit to doing the work with us and show up every week to participate.

## Project Description

The portfolio club is focused on building a business-oriented application that features Redux to manage state.

As part of the process, there will be prompts and activities that will contribute to your development journal. Showcasing the things you learned and the process you followed while creating your project will help you to stand out to prospective employers (and help you remember how you solved a problem when it arises again!)

At the end of the portfolio club, you will have a working application as well as a case study that you can publish to "show your work".

**The case study is an in-depth article or blog post that carries just as much (if not more) weight as your actual code when it comes to proving your knowledge and skills.**

## Prerequisites

Working knowledge of building websites (HTML, CSS, JS)

Familiarity with React.

A blog or other place to publish your case study and development journal.

## Portfolio Club Logistics

5 weeks of one-hour sessions, with around 10 members

Each session will consist of sharing the work accomplished since the last meeting, and discussion about the readings and resources to prepare for the next.

## Club Commitment

Missing 1 session is fine, more than that and we might ask you to leave the club (don't worry, you'll be able to join future clubs).

The same is true for showing up unprepared ðŸ˜…

This Developer Portfolio Club will follow the [egghead Community Code of Conduct](https://howtoegghead.com/code-of-conduct/).
Please be sure to read the Code of Conduct, and be prepared to hold others to it as well.

We will be actively reviewing applications. If you are not selected for this round, don't worry! There will be future clubs you can participate in.
